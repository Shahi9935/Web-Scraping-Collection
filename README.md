# Web-Scraping-Collection
This repository contains the web scraping projects that I have built using Python.

Each folder is a seperate web scraping project.

Each folder contains a KNOWME.txt file that contains information about that project.

Each folder has a main.py file.

Just run that file and you will be able to use it.

Thanks!
